## About Us

At OSign, our goal is simple: to make the signing and installation of iOS applications more direct and more reliable.

Traditional signing workflows depend on a computer, environment setup, and multiple complex steps. OSign eliminates these barriers with a lightweight approach that allows IPA signing to be completed quickly, locally, and without unnecessary complications.

## What We Offer

OSign is a tool dedicated to local IPA signing and installation, designed with the following priorities:

- Local processing of IPA, p12, and provisioning files
- No uploading, storing, or sharing of any signing data
- Avoiding common system warnings such as "Unable to Install" or "Unable to Verify"
- Suitable for development testing, internal distribution, and small-scale deployments

The entire process is simple and straightforward—no computer required, and no jailbreak needed.

## Our Philosophy

The core principles of OSign are transparency, security, and user control:

- All signing data is processed locally
- No third-party app downloads
- No attempts to bypass system mechanisms
- Every feature is built with safety in mind

Our mission is to make iOS testing and distribution more efficient while maintaining clear boundaries and a clean, dependable user experience.

## Our Direction

OSign will continue to improve compatibility and stability, providing users with a smooth and reliable signing experience. We will also introduce more practical supporting features to make the app testing workflow even more seamless in the future.
